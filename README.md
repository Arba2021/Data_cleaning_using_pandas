# My First Data Science Project: TV Shows Analysis

## Overview
This is my first data science project. I worked with a CSV file (`shows.csv`) containing TV shows data, cleaned it, and visualized the number of shows aired per year. This project helped me learn how to work with data, clean it, and create simple plots in Python.

The dataset has:

- **title** – TV show name  
- **year** – Year the show aired  
- **episodes** – Number of episodes  

## What I Learned
- Reading CSV files with **pandas**  
- Cleaning data (removing missing values and duplicates)  
- Sorting and converting data types  
- Grouping data and simple analysis  
- Creating line plots with **matplotlib**  
- Annotating plots and showing totals  

## Features
- Remove rows with missing episodes  
- Remove duplicate titles  
- Sort shows by year and title  
- Convert episodes to integers  
- Count total shows and episodes  
- Show number of shows per year in a line plot  
- Display a summary box with total shows and episodes  

## Requirements
- Python 3  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`  

Install libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
